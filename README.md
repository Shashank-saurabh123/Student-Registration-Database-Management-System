# Student-Registration-Database-Management-System
Developed a Student Registration Database Management System project in October 2022.
Created an ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram to represent the data model for the system.
Designed a relational schema diagram to translate the ER diagram into a set of normalized tables to eliminate data redundancy and ensure data integrity.
Defined primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to maintain the integrity of the database.
Wrote and executed SQL scripts to create tables as defined in the relational schema.
Ensured data consistency through the use of constraints and normalization techniques.
Focused on maintaining database integrity by eliminating redundancies and enforcing relational rules.
